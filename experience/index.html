	<h2>Byte Dance. <em>Intern, System Network Department</em></h2>
		<p>Applied data analyzing and machine learning methods such as linear regression to predict failure of optical transceivers 
			to avoid further loss using Python scripts.
			Worked on the back-end side to analyze storage data about predicted failures in tables using platforms such as Flink.
			Involved in the front-end team to design a webpage that displays the list of optical transceivers that tend to fail, 
			along with graphs about details like power and bias to help users conveniently determine the status of the transceivers.</p>
